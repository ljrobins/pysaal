COMPUTER SOFTWARE ORIGINALLY RELEASED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
AS REPRESENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY LISTED BELOW (&quot;GOVERNMENT

SOFTWARE, AS DEFINED HEREIN, OR ANY PART THEREOF, IS, BY THAT ACTION,
ACCEPTING IN FULL THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED IN

The intended purpose of the SGP4 propagator is to properly propagate an
object&#39;s Two Line Element Set (TLE) supplied by 18 Space Defense Squadron (18 SDS)
such that the positions calculated for that object agree with those
calculated by 18 SDS.  SGP4 propagator is to be used solely for the
purpose of propagating 18 SDS created TLEs.  TLEs created and supplied by the
18 SDS are created in such a way as to be compatible with the SGP4
propagator.  In this way, compatibility/interoperability issues between the
18 SDS and the user of 18 SDS SGP4 TLEs are addressed. Examples of what SGP4
should not be used for, included but are not limited to, propagating 18 SDS
created state vectors which come from any of the various other messages the
18 SDS creates, such as Vector Covariance Messages, Orbital Conjunction
Messages, Conjunction Data Messages, etc.
